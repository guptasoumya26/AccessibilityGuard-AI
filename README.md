## üñºÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input URLs:** Enter the base and PR URLs (e.g., http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:8001).
2. **Screenshot & DOM Capture:** Selenium grabs fresh screenshots and DOMs for both URLs.
3. **AI Analysis:** Vision LLM analyzes each screenshot for accessibility issues.
4. **Visual Comparison:** See side-by-side reports and interactive charts. Instantly spot new issues in the PR!
